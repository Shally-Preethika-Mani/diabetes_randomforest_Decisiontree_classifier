# Diabetes_Randomforest_Decisiontree_classifier

Main Objective:

The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

Context: 

This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. I have downloaded this dataset from kaggle.
Link for the dataset in kaggle is given below:
       https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
      
Description: 

In this project, I have used Two Machine Learning Algorithms. 
Those two algorithms are:
1. Decision trees classifier
2. Random forest Classifier

The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one Target variable, Outcome. 

Predictor variables includes:
1. The number of Pregnancies the patient has had
2. BMI
3. Insulin level
4. Age
5. Glucose- Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
6. Blood Pressure
7. Skinthickness
8. DiabetesPedigreeFunction

Target variables include:
1. Outcome

About the Dataset:

The dataset consists of 768 rows and 9 columns.
